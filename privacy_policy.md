Velo Sudoku collects only the minimum amount of information necessary to show advertising and keep statistics.

We use Google AdMob to serve ads. When non-personalized ads are selected, Google delivers contextual ads using coarse location, content keywords or general device information only. No ad personalization profile is built for you inside the app.

If you enable personalized ads, Google AdMob may use your advertising ID and activity across other apps to tailor content. You can change this decision at any time from the advertising consent screen.

We do not store personal data on our own servers. Advertising preferences and the information about accepting the policy are saved only on your device in encrypted shared preferences.

For error diagnostics the app may collect anonymous crash reports that include device model, Android version and stack trace. These reports never contain gameplay data nor any information that directly identifies you.
