# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 11, 2026*


## Privacy Policy for Velo Sudoku

### 1. Introduction
This privacy policy explains how data is processed and protected in the **Velo Sudoku** mobile application (hereinafter "App"). We respect user privacy and are committed to transparency regarding the technologies used.

### 2. Data and Permissions
The App does not have its own backend server and does not transmit personal user data to the Developer. We do not require account creation or provide names/emails.

However, the App may process data in the following ways:
* **Local Processing:** The App saves game progress, settings, and statistics exclusively in the internal memory of the user's device.
* **Third-Party Processing:** The App uses external libraries (SDKs) such as Google AdMob and Firebase, which may automatically collect and transmit device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), approximate location data, and diagnostic data for ad delivery and crash analysis.

### 3. Third-Party Partners
As a developer, we do not collect user data on our own servers, but we have integrated third-party services that may collect data according to their own policies:

**A. Google AdMob (Advertising)**
Ad provider. May use device identifiers to personalize ads and prevent fraud.
* Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

**B. Google Firebase (Analytics & Crashlytics)**
Tool for crash analysis. Collects anonymous crash reports (e.g., device model, OS version) to help us fix bugs in the App.
* Firebase Privacy Policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

### 4. Purpose of Actions
The actions taken by the App are intended for:
1.  **Game Functionality (Local):** Saving game state so the user does not lose progress after closing the App.
2.  **Monetization (Partners):** Displaying ads, which allows the game to be provided for free.
3.  **Technical Maintenance (Partners):** Monitoring app stability and fixing bugs based on anonymized reports.

### 5. Data Deletion and "Right to be Forgotten"
Since the App does not use a user account system, the Developer does not have the technical ability to delete a specific user's data from servers (as no such data is stored there by the Developer).

You can manage or delete your data locally:

1.  **Local Data (Game Progress, Settings):**
    All game data is stored locally on your device. You can permanently delete this data by:
    * Uninstalling the App.
    * Clearing the App's storage in Android settings (*Settings -> Apps -> Velo Sudoku -> Storage -> Clear Data*).

2.  **Advertising and Analytics Data (Google/AdMob):**
    You can reset your Advertising ID or opt-out of personalized ads at any time via your device settings:
    * *Android Settings -> Google -> Ads -> Reset advertising ID* or *Delete advertising ID*.
    * To manage data associated with your Google account, please visit: https://myactivity.google.com/

### 6. GDPR (Users in Europe)
Under the GDPR, users in the European Economic Area (EEA) have the right to consent to or opt-out of personalized advertising. Upon the first launch of the App, a Consent Form is displayed allowing you to manage your preferences. You can change these settings at any time within the "Privacy" section of the App.
