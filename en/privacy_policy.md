# Privacy Policy for Velo Sudoku

**Last Updated:** February 08, 2026

### 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy sets out the rules for the processing and protection of data in the **Velo Sudoku** mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "App"). We respect user privacy and ensure transparency regarding the technologies used.

### 2. Data, Permissions, and No Backend
The App does not have its own server (backend) and does not transmit the user's personal data to the Developer. We do not require account creation, login, or providing a name or email address.

The App processes data in the following ways:
* **Local Processing:** Game progress, settings, and statistics are stored exclusively in the secure internal memory of the user's device.
* **Third-Party Processing:** The App uses external libraries (SDKs) that may collect device identifiers and diagnostic data, **exclusively after obtaining explicit User consent**. No telemetry data is sent automatically before this consent is granted.

### 3. Third-Party Partners and Data Sharing
We have integrated services from trusted third parties. We do not have direct access to the data collected by these systems.

**A. Google AdMob (Ads)**
Ad provider. May use device identifiers to personalize ads.
* **Consent:** Personalized ads are displayed only after consent is granted in the CMP (Consent Management Platform) window.
* Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

**B. Google Firebase (Stats and Stability)**
Tools for crash analysis (Crashlytics) and usage statistics (Analytics).
* **Consent:** Crash reports and performance data **are not sent automatically**. The User must explicitly consent to the collection of analytical/diagnostic data in the welcome form. Without this consent, the App does not remotely monitor errors or performance.

**C. Google Play Services (Payments)**
The App uses Google Play services to handle purchases. The Developer does not have access to the User's financial data.

### 4. Purpose of Actions
The actions taken by the App aim to:
1.  **Game Functionality:** Saving game state (Save/Load) – local data.
2.  **Maintenance & Development:** Monitoring bugs and stats – **only with User consent**.
3.  **Monetization:** Displaying ads – **personalized only with User consent**.

### 5. Data Deletion
Full control over data lies with the User.

**Managing Game Progress (Local Data):**
* **Deleting Individual Entries:** The User can manually delete specific score entries within the Statistics section.
* **Complete Data Removal:** To permanently delete all progress, the User must uninstall the App or clear its storage (*Android Settings -> Apps -> Velo Sudoku -> Storage -> Clear Data*).

**Managing Consents (External Data):**
The User can withdraw consent for analytics and ads at any time within the App Settings, which will immediately stop data transmission to partners.

### 6. GDPR / RODO (User Consent)
In accordance with GDPR, users from the EEA and the UK have full rights to decide about their data.
* Upon the first launch, a **Consent Form (CMP)** is displayed.
* The User decides separately about **ads** and **analytics/performance data**.
* If the User does not grant consent, no data will be sent to Google Firebase or AdMob (regarding personalization).
* This decision can be changed in the App Settings ("Privacy" button).
